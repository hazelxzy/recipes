        <h3>A waffle with honey and butter</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. It's okay if there are a few lumps.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in the beaten egg whites until just combined.</li>
            <li>Spray the preheated waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Pour enough batter onto the center of the waffle iron to cover about two-thirds of the grid surface.</li>
            <li>Close the lid and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions, or until the waffles are golden brown and crisp.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the waffles from the waffle iron and serve immediately with your favorite toppings.</li>
        </ol>
