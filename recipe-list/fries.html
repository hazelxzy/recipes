        <h3>A plate of french fries</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>2-3 cups of vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the potatoes and rinse them under cold water to remove excess starch.</li>
            <li>Cut the potatoes into even-sized strips, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl of cold water and let them soak for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
            <li>After soaking, drain the potatoes and pat them dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel.</li>
            <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or deep fryer, heat the vegetable oil to 325째F (165째C).</li>
            <li>Carefully add a handful of potatoes to the hot oil, ensuring they are not overcrowded. Fry them for about 4-5 minutes, or until they are just beginning to turn golden brown.</li>
            <li>Use a slotted spoon or a wire mesh skimmer to remove the partially fried potatoes from the oil and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet. Let them cool for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat of the oil to 375째F (190째C). Once the oil is hot, add the partially fried potatoes back into the oil in batches. Fry for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy.</li>
            <li>Once the fries are done, remove them from the oil and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Immediately sprinkle them with salt while they are still hot.</li>
            <li>Serve the fries hot with your favorite dipping sauce or enjoy them on their own.</li>
        </ol>
