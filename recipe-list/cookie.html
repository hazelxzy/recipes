        <h3>A plate of chocolate chip cookies</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
            <li>Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may still look slightly underbaked, but they will continue to set as they cool.</li>
            <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies!</li>
        </ol>
